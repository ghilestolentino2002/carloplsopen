    <p>Never had much faith in love or miracles (ooh)<br>
        Never wanna put my heart on the line (ooh)<br>

        I'm born again every time you spend the night (ooh)</p>
    <p>'Cause your sex takes me to paradise<br>
        Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise<br>
        And it shows<br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
    <p>'Cause you make me feel like<br>
        I've been locked out of heaven<br>
        For too long, for too long<br>
        Yeah, you make me feel like<br>
        I've been locked out of heaven<br>
        For too long, for too long, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh</p>

        Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
        Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (ooh)</p>
    <p>You bring me to my knees, you make me testify (ooh)<br>
        You can make a sinner change his ways (ooh)<br>
        Open up your gates 'cause I can't wait to see the light (ooh)<br>
        And right there is where I wanna stay (ooh)</p>
    <p>'Cause your sex takes me to paradise<br>
        Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise<br>
        And it shows<br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
    <p>'Cause you make me feel like<br>
        I've been locked out of heaven<br>
        For too long, for too long<br>
        Yeah, you make me feel like<br>
        I've been locked out of heaven<br>
        For too long, for too long, oh</p>
    <p>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
        Can I just stay here?<br>
        Spend the rest of my days here?<br>
