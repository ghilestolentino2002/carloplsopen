        Yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
    <p>'Cause you make me feel like<br>
        I've been locked out of heaven<br>
        For too long, for too long<br>
        Yeah, you make me feel like<br>
        I've been locked out of heaven<br>

        You can make a sinner change his ways (ooh)<br>
        Open up your gates 'cause I can't wait to see the light (ooh)<br>
        And right there is where I wanna stay (ooh)</p>
    <p>'Cause your sex takes me to paradise<br>

        I've been locked out of heaven<br>
        For too long, for too long, oh</p>
    <p>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
        Can I just stay here?<br>
        Spend the rest of my days here?<br>
